# The Project

TremorTrackr is a wearable device designed to monitor and analyze hand tremors for individuals with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremors. Developed using an Arduino Nano, an IMU sensor, and an EMG sensor, the device captures detailed motion and muscle activity data. This information is safely stored in a Firebase database and desployed on a Flask-run user-friendly website, enabling patients and doctors to track tremor severity and evaluate treatment efficacy. Furthermore, the data is processed and analyzed with Python SciPy Signal Functions.
