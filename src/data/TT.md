# The Project

TremorTrackr is a comprehensive tremor monitoring system designed to help individuals with Parkinson's disease track and analyze their tremors in real-time. The system combines hardware sensors, data processing algorithms, and a web-based interface to provide accurate tremor frequency and power measurements. Built with dual sensors (IMU and EMG), TremorTrackr enables users to track treatment effectiveness and monitor tremor patterns throughout the day by quantifying tremors in real-time.

# Key Features

* _Dual Sensor System_: Combines Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Electromyography (EMG) sensors for comprehensive tremor analysis
* _Advanced Signal Processing_: Uses Butterworth filtering, Hilbert transforms, and Welch's method for accurate frequency analysis
* _Real-time Data Collection_: Wireless data transmission from Arduino to Flask server with batch processing
* _Web-based Interface_: User-friendly dashboard with real-time charts and historical data tracking
* _Secure Authentication_: Local authentication system with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 password hashing and encrypted storage
