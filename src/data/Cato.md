# The Project

Cato is a ground-up, AI-powered bi-encoded semantic search engine designed to automate technical support for complex developer tools. This system consolidates fragmented internal knowledge—spanning historical support tickets, corporate documentation, and chat conversations—into a unified, searchable intelligence layer that delivers fast, accurate, and non-hallucinated answers to developer questions.

# Key Features

* _Knowledge Consolidation_: Ingests over two years of support data including thousands of service request logs, 1,000+ internal wiki documents, and curated chat conversations
* _Bi-Encoder Architecture_: Two-stage semantic retrieval with fine-tuned bi-encoder for candidate retrieval and domain-tuned cross-encoder for precision re-ranking
* _Low Latency_: Responds in under 20 seconds, reducing resolution time from multi-day SLAs to near-instant
* _Production API_: Structured JSON responses enable easy integration with internal tools and dashboards
* _High Accuracy_: Successfully answers approximately 50–60% of weekly support questions without human intervention
