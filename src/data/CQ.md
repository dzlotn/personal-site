# The Project

CampusQuest analyzes the path of seniors from your high school going to college. It discovers information like geographical trends, popular majors, college acceptance rates, and provides insights into the most common college destinations. It also converts all college destinations and majors into one comprehensive map! This tool helps students make informed decisions about their higher education journey.
