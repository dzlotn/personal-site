# The Project

CausticGuard is a motion-adaptive caustics suppression system for underwater computer vision. The system addresses the challenging problem of caustic patterns in underwater imagery by implementing adaptive algorithms that suppress these visual artifacts while preserving image quality and detail. This technology enhances the reliability of underwater computer vision applications by improving image clarity and reducing noise from light refraction patterns.

# Key Features

* _Motion Adaptation_: Adapts caustics suppression based on motion patterns in underwater scenes
* _Pattern Detection_: Identifies and analyzes caustic patterns in real-time
* _Image Enhancement_: Suppresses caustics while preserving important image details
* _Real-time Processing_: Processes underwater video streams with low latency
* _Quality Preservation_: Maintains image quality and contrast during suppression
