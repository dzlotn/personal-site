# The Project

TariffInsight is a comprehensive Django web application built for Finger Lake Goods that forecasts the financial impact of tariffs on sales revenue using advanced time series analysis. The system helps businesses understand potential revenue losses, recovery timelines, and compare scenarios across different tariff implementation dates. Built with SARIMAX modeling, TariffInsight quantifies financial impacts in dollar amounts and provides interactive visualizations for data-driven decision making.

# Key Features

* _SARIMAX Forecasting_: Uses Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables to predict sales patterns with weekly seasonality
* _Multi-Scenario Comparison_: Compares multiple tariff implementation dates side-by-side to identify optimal timing and worst-case scenarios
* _Statistical Analysis_: Calculates comprehensive metrics including MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R², and correlation coefficients for model validation
* _Financial Impact Quantification_: Provides dollar-amount estimates of cumulative revenue losses and mean daily impacts
* _Interactive Visualization_: Generates forecast charts with confidence intervals, baseline comparisons, and cumulative impact graphs
