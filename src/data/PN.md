# The Project

Project Nexus is a sophisticated freight disruption and route optimization system that helps logistics and trucking companies make data-driven decisions. The system monitors real-time disruptions affecting freight routes, optimizes routing decisions based on current conditions, and calculates the economic impact of delays and rerouting options. This comprehensive solution improves supply chain resilience and operational efficiency by leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning models. This project was built when I was a Technology Implementation Associate at Cornell Data Strategy.

# Key Features
* _Real-time Monitoring_: Tracks disruptions such as accidents, severe weather, and road closures
